dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "yea! the rabbit is named rubert, and the cat is named samantha. theyre both dead :P");
dialog.add(spr_bennytalkingneutral, "Right. I'm gonna need you to elaborate on that one.");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "well, you see, in life they were sinners of the worst variety. crooks, gamblers, thieves. they stole and they conned their way out of every situation");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "they were also violently, passionately in love. they were two peas in a pod, each other's equals, a match made in heaven");
dialog.add(spr_bennytalkingneutral, "Well, shame they had to live a life of crime, but at least they had love.");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "yea not for long tho. see, they were similar. too similar. you know that phrase 'there's something about you that i don't like about me?'");
dialog.add(spr_bennytalkingneutral, "I'm familiar.");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "well these two were that to a tea. i mean they had the same favorite food, same evil schemes, same fatal flaws. eventually it got to the point where they were driving each other insane!!");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "it got to the point where they were actively sabotoging each other. samantha would 'accidentally' step on rubert's toe. rubert would 'accidently' call the cops when samantha was doing a bank heist.");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "one day, samantha SNAPPED and said 'Rubert, I've had it up to here with you!' and so she shot him in the chest, nine times");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "unfortunately, rubert had his own trick up his sleeve. he faked being dead, and then just when she turned around he shot her in the back TEN times! they both died of blood loss");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "now they hang here in the pits of hell forevermore");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "however, their torture is not that of fire and brimstone. instead, its each other :0");
dialog.add(spr_bennytalkingneutral, "... You know, I would be shocked, but after nine years of parenthood I've realized this is just how little girls play with dolls.");
dialog.add(spr_cattyfaceshadow, "yea pretty much");
